Command to run:

./lab2_add --threads=# --iterations=# | tee -a lab2_add.csv

2.1.1 
It takes a large number of iterations before errors are seen because for a small number of iterations, 
each thread is able to finish its computation, for the number of times its required to, before the end
of its time slice. This leads to minimal context switches and race conditions, within the loop for 
updating the counter.

2.1.2
The --yield runs much slower due to the cost of context switching. The additional time goes
into switching into Kernel mode, performing the context switch, and switching back to user mode.
It isn't possible to get valid per-operation timings for the --yield option since we cannot
calculate how much time is being used to perform the context switch. This leads to a skewed
total time measurement for the lab2_add program, which leads to a skewed per operation time
when the yield option is enabled.
