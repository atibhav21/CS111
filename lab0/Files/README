The included files in the tarball are:
lab0.c - The source file that copies data from stdin to stdout
		 It works with other options like --input, --output, --segfault 
		 and --catch
Makefile - The makefile for building the source file, and running smoke tests.
			It also supports clean, and dist to clean the directory and build
			a distributable tarball.

breakpoint.png - Screenshot showing that execution paused before the fault, 
				and inspection of the pointer.
README - file describing the contents of the tarball

Smoke Test Cases:
The make check command runs five smoke tests. The purpose of each of these is
described below:
1. First test checks the functionality of the program when both an input and 
	output file are provided
2. Checks the functionality when only the output file is provided, and input
	is read from stdin
3. Checks the functionality when only an input file is provided and output
	is sent to stdout
4. Checks that the program exits correctly (with the correct return code) 
	when the input file cannot be opened
5. Checks if the --segfault option and the --catch option work correctly
