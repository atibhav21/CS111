The tarball contains 4 files:

1. README: The file that describes the contents of the tarball
2. Makefile: The file that sets the targets for the make command.
			It supports make client, make server, make, make clean
			and make dist
3. lab1b-client.c: This is the file that contains the source code
			for the client program. The client program attempts to
			connect to the server and display the output of the 
			commands from the server's shell. It also supports a
			compress option to send the data over the socket in a
			compressed form.
4. lab1b-server.c: This is the file the contains the source code for
			the server. It sets up a socket, and accepts connections
			from the client. On successfully connecting to a client,
			it starts a bash shell, and sends the results of executing
			commands from the shell back to the client. On exiting, it
			reports the exit status of the shell. It also supports a 
			compress option that sends the data over the socket connection
			in a compressed form.
