The Tarball consists of the following files:

Makefile: Contains the GNU make to build the project. The default target is 
		make and builds the program lab4b. It supports the make check target 
		which runs some smoke tests to see if the program can interact with the
		sensors. It supports a dist target which generates the tarball, and a 
		clean which removes all the files generated by the Makefile

README: Contains information about the tarball

lab4b.c: Source code for the program that connects to the Beaglebone sensors,
		and performs the functions described in the project spec.
